# Customer Single View üå±
A comprehensive and unified representation of a customer's data and interactions across various touchpoints and systems within a business. It provides a consolidated and real-time snapshot of customer information, enabling better decision-making and personalized customer experiences.
# Use Case : Bearhouse üßã
Bearhouse, a Thai milk tea brand owned by two renowned YouTubers that  I admire.
### Pain Point üò£
- The current Bearhouse customer relationship management system is not comprehensive. It only collects the spending amount of customers, but not the specific products that they purchase, which limits the insights that the company can gain about their customers' preferences.
### Remark ‚ÄºÔ∏è
- This canva provides practical advice for bubble tea chain stores on how to design a Customer Single View and choose the right data to collect.
