- Oasis Coffee Rangnam is one of two branches of Oasis Coffee; the other one is located in Huai Khwang. This shop is owned by two close friends of different ages who initially met through the power of a Buddha Amulet.
- Now, let's get to the point. I once scraped reviews from Google Maps Reviews, but the web scraping code is no longer functional. This time, I will manually collect data by sampling about 20 reviews from the Wongnai Website.
