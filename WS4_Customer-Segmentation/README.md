In 1986, Mr. Peter Chia left his job to seek a better life for his family. With the support of his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Chia, he started a business, emphasizing complete honesty. This business, HDI, became a pioneer in network marketing in Asia, providing millions with opportunities for a better life. HDI has since expanded into various industries, guided by the principle of working from the heart and doing good for others.

A business model where individuals promote and sell products or services while recruiting others into the network. Distributors earn commissions from their own sales and those made by their recruits. MLM has a hierarchical structure, emphasizes recruitment, and has faced controversy due to its recruitment-focused nature.
